# ScriptForGoogleSheets

I use this script to automatically manage google sheets. 
In particular, I need that the script automatically fills a specific cell with text when someone empties the sheet.
In order to run the script H24 I use https://console.cloud.google.com/.

The python file take personal keys from a .json file, that I can't publish for obvious reasons
